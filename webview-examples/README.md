This crate contains several examples of how to use the `web-view` crate.
To run one of these examples, you can run (in this directory):

```plain
cargo run --example <name-of-example>
```

where `<name-of-example>` is one of the source-code files examples/*.rs,
minus the .rs suffix (e.g., `minimal`, `todo`,...).

For information on each example, see [this README](examples/README.md).
